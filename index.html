<h1>IT'S KNISHMAS!</h1>
<p>Hey! Hey! Wake up! It's almost time for <strong >knishmas</strong>, everyone. I think...I honestly forgot the last time we had it. <em>Oh yeah, December 4th of 2008.</em></p> It's been such a long time since we had the last one. Honestly, it's been really long since we last saw Chowder, I'm guessing. <br>So rejoice! Let's celebrate Knishmas together by paying our favorite purple ball of collective fat with the tendencies of my garbage disposal another visit for old times sake, huh?...wait, are you embarassed? <br> <br>DON'T BE! PULL UP IN A UGLY SWEATER OR ONESIE MAYBE EVEN BOTH! the holy swea-onesie. I might even buy this bundle of stupid adorableness.
